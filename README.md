# GMTK 2020 - Out Of Control
Presented here is the source for my GMTK 2020 Game Jam submission, uninterestingly named Out Of Control after the Jam theme. This was my first swing at a Game Jam and my first Game Maker Studio project and as such it doesn't take many risks, lacks decent UX and is very brief. Everyone starts somewhere though, so I thought it worthwhile to download the source, upgrade it to the newest version of GMS and fix the fatal error that prevented it from working originally.
## Gameplay
This game was meant from the beginning to play similarly to [The World's Hardest Game](https://www.addictinggames.com/action/the-worlds-hardest-game), with a graphical twist and a control limitation to fit the theme. Also unlike the original, it is NOT deafening and actually can be MUTED. (Fair warning on those clicking the above link). The player has a stamina bar that depletes with any movement and when completely empty the player can no longer move. Staying still for a brief period will allow the player's stamina to regenerate. There are 18 levels and a few of them are just hallways with no hazards.
